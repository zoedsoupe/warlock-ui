# Warlock UI

> Components as they should: elegant, functional and magical! âœ¨

Provides a collection of unstyled and accessible components for Phoenix Live View framework.

## Installation

Warlock UI is in *early development stage*, but you can try it (and should do it!) by installing it from the `hex.pm`.

Notice that as it is a Phoenix Live View component library, Warlock UI depends on `:phoenix` and `:phoenix_live_view` packages.

Add the folowwing line into your `deps/0` function on `mix.exs`:

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:warlock_ui, "~> 0.1.0-alpha"}
  ]
end
```
